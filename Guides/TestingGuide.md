### API Testing
- export postman file from testing folder
- test all api from here
  - JWT Auth is used
  - Test conditions which can break program like unauthorized access, asking detail of user that doesn't exsist

### Sockets Testing (Pull Request 2)
- open index.html from Testing folder twice
- open index2.html once
- open console for all three
- give attendence now, valid and invalid
##### Expected Behaviour
- both index.html file when given same valid otp(event) will group them and start showing on both of them (notice in console)
##### YouAreDoingWrong!
- update index.html and index.html2 with valid JWT token before you start
- Understand how different event users are getting grouped event wise so to test more breifly
